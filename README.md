# Component-based Data Visualization 

Let's build some data visualizations! By combining D3 with popular JavaScript 
frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular, we can create SVG-based charts and 
maps while retaining all the benefits of using a modern front-end framework. 
Michael Bowman, Director of Engineering at Mile Two, will walk through the 
construction of several data visualizations and attendees will walk away with 
ideas on how to integrate D3 into their own applications.
